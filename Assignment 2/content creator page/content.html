<center>TheTimTracker is a youtube vlogger who specializes in talking about theme parks with a focus on orlando florida.</center>

<Center>His videos are also very binge watchable and i can always go back to watch his old content.</Center>
<center>I highly recommend checking him out! Click on the picture to be taken to his youtube channel.</center>
