<h1>Here are some of my projects that i worked on last semester.</h1>
</div>
<div style="position: absolute; left:10px; top:500px">
<p>This was an editing project where i edited an action scene for the short film bingo night.</p>
<p>It was the first action scene i ever edited and i had a blast making it.</p>
<p>The film itself is pretty great too! I'd recommend checking out the original cut.</p>
</div>
<div style="position: absolute; left:620px; top:500px">
<p>This was my final project for my tv and film production class. It was a parody of work training videos.</p>
<p>I actually filmed and edited this all in one day. It was a struggle but i think it turned out great.</p>
</div>
<div style="position: absolute; left:1309px; top:500px">
<p>This was another edit for the short film bingo night.</p>
<p>This was more of a lowkey scene unlike the first video and one of the harder edits i had to do.</p>
<p>The hardest part was trying to get the angles right so no jump cuts were in the video. Turns out editing films is way harder than i thought!</p>
